GENERAL OVERVIEW
pyPA is a suite of Process Analysis post-processing tools written in Python.  The general purpose is
to develop a conceptual ozone accumulation process for an area larger than a single model cell.  The
process outline follows.

STEPS
1) Decide what cells are of interest
2) Run the model (cmaq, camx, or wrf) with PA extensions enabled
3) Prepare PA outputs for post-processing (mainly for cmaq)
4) Check for reasonable results
5) Extract values for each process and reaction
6) Combine cell process and reaction values to a single volume set 
   of process and reaction values
7) Add processes to account for changes in the volume through time
   (e.g. growth of the planetary boundary layer or movement to track a plume)
8) Visualize processes and/or reactions
9) Create a set of net reactions

MAPPING STEPS TO PYTHON
1-2) Are outside the scope of the post-processor.  
3)   Functions for step 3, which is primarily for CMAQ, are in cmaqprep.py
4)   Functions for step 4, which should be done for any model are in pa_qa.py (also a script)
5-7) Functions are in pappt.py, which is the core post-processor
8)   In development, but not yet available
9)   Currently fullfilled by the net_balance project.  Functions in legacy.py help prepare data from 
     steps 5-7 for this net_balance_CB4.py.  Soon that functionality will be updated based on a 
     variant, which can interact with a more flexible data type.

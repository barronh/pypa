Python-based Process Analysis (pypa) is designed to integrate process data from Eulerian models.  This can be as simple as integration of discretized intrinsic values from grid cells into a conceptual group.  It can also maintaining continuity for a group of cells that moves through a Eulerian grid (e.g., a plume).  For more information, see the [detailed description](DetailedOverview.md).

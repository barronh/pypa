# Configuartion Species #

The species configuration key is a list of model species.  Each model/mechanism combination has different nomenclature for chemical compounds.  You must provide a list of species for your specific combination.  Most species can be entered without quotations (e.g. NO2), but others (e.g. NO) can be confused for meaningful words (e.g. No) and must be enclosed in quotes (e.g. "NO").

species: [O3, NO2, "NO"]

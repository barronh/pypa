# Overview #
To run pypa, first you must have Process Analysis outputs from a Eulerian model.  Then, you have to tell pypa where they are and what you expect them to contain and how to aggregate cells.  Then pypa can create a conceptual volume.

# Steps In Creating a Process Analysis #
  1. [Use an air quality model to create model Process Analysis Outputs](CreateModelPAOutput.md)
  1. [Detailed Configuration File Description](ConfigYaml.md)
  1. [Use pyPA to create model mixing volume data](RunPyPA.md)
  1. [Use permm to create figures and analysis](http://code.google.com/p/permm)
